The Reading Room is a non-profit operation and registered charity. We seek funding from various resources including government grants, other foundation supports and private sponsorship according to the purpose and nature of each program and activity. We also receive books and financial donation from the public and hold fundraising project/event to ensure the organization’s livelihood and sustainability.
